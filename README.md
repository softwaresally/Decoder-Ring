For this project, I was tasked with creating an app that will encode and decode messages, using a test-driven development process.
This project was designed to test my ability to build complex algorithms. 
When encoding and decoding the messages, the input and output characters are translated and/or "shifted" to their new character.

In this project, I used Mocha and Chai, and used expect() methods to test my code.
I hope to use this project in the future to demonstrate my abilities to create complex web applications.
